# <Myles Portfolio>

## Description

- I was going for a left right back and forth type of webpage here with the picture and the text on the side.
- I mainly made this assignment so that I could add more projects in the future. The layout of this website is built to be able to expand in the future.
- The project will eventually be able to be my portfolio for the future and help me get a reputation in the future by showing off work and projects that I have completed.
- In the end I learnerd a lot about how flex boxes and margins work while working around text.
