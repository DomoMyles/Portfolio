<p>This is a once largely popular two dimensional game. Yes it was a really popular two dimensional game
even when there dimensional games were out. The reason for this is because the story and background to
this game is amazing. He only thought he and his friends would like this game and he was surprised on 
how much money he made off this game. He had no idea how much he underestimated his game. This game goes as
far as to break the fourth wall and even crash the game for a purpose.
</p>
<p>This game may be two dimensional but it has an amazing background and gameplay to it. There is many ways
you can beat the game and many secrets. You are a child who falls down into the underground where monsters 
were cast away and locked in  by the barrier. Unlike your thought of monsters, these monsters are nice even
know they attack you. You have a choice to attack them and kill them or spare them. If you choose to attack
them then you will gain what is called <strong><a href="http://undertale.wikia.com/wiki/Stats#LOVE">LOVE,
</a></strong> from some of the monsters. Love stands for <em>Level Of Violence</em>, and it increases your
 health.</p>

<hr>
<strong><center><h3><font color="orange">Neutral</font color="orange"></h3></center></strong>
<hr><br>
The Neutral ending is where you go through and either kill or spare any amount of monsters you encounter.
 This is the easiest to obtain ending due to the fact that some monsters are easier to kill while some others
 are easier to spare. It does not matter how many monsters you kill or spare as long as you kill at least one.
 and spare at least one.
 <br><br><hr>
 <strong><center><h3><font color="green">Pacifist</font color="red"></h3></center></strong>
 <hr><br>
 The True Pacifist ending is when you spare every monster you encounter. This ending is fairly hard due
 to what happens at the end. When you do true pacifist ending, you will spare the king and then you will
 encounter a boss battle who takes the "happy ending" away by killing the king then fighting you. One
 amazing thing the creator did was he made it so when you first see the boss, the game is programed to
 crash. Upon restarting, you no longer have the option to reset instead you are shown the screen of the 
 flower who you later battle when he obsorbs the <a href="http://undertale.wikia.com/wiki/Eight_Humans">
 souls.</a href="http://undertale.wikia.com/wiki/Eight_Humans"> But when you beat him he asks for death
 but to each for the true pacifist ending you have sp spare him regardless of what he has done. This 
 ending is  no longer obtainable when you do a full Genocide run.
 <br><br><hr>
 <strong><center><h3><font color="red">Genocide</font color="red"></h3></center></strong>
 <hr><br>
 In Genocide mode you not only have to kill every monster you encounter, but you have to try to find them.
 There are sort of bosses after each "stage" in the game. If you wish to do full genocide mode then you
 have to go through and spend some time walking around trying to find monsters until the music changes and
 you go into a battle but it says "But nobody came". When you reach this stage it becomes a one hit for 
 each boss to kill. When you do this you will come into the hardest battle in the game that is only
 accessible through this path. If you complete this path all the way to then end it will make the true 
 Pacifist ending unable to obtain even if you do a true reset.
 <br><br>
 <strong><h2><center>Resets</center></h2></strong>
 <hr><br>
 Reset is what you do when you complete a run. When you do one of the runs you can no longer play unless
 you reset. When you start over there are slight differences in what happens, for instance, When you 
 meet sans the first time he says turn around and shake my hand, then you do it. On the second reset,
 you are turned around before he finishes. Sans is not the only monster that remembers slightly, others will
 sort of recall your decisions the last run. But one monster that remembers everything is Flowey, he is the
 boss in the pacifist run. Flowey will remember what you did in the last reset and is full aware of them.

<strong><h3><center><font color="yellow">Flowey<sup>Boss</sup></font color="yellow"></center></h3></strong>

<img src="God_flowey.png">
<br><hr>
Flowey is one of the most mysterious monsters in the game. Through the game you will find out that he once
had the ability to reset as you do in the game, but when you come he lost that power. Even though he has 
lost the power to reset, he is able to remember everything that happens before you reset. If you are trying 
the full pacifist and you kill the monster guarding the door to exit the ruins on accident, you would 
want to exit the game and come back to your last save point. When you spare her after accidentally killing
her flowey will be on the other side of the door. He will say he knew you killed her but you decided to undo
it. Flowey is also the one who shows you how things work underground when you first start, explaining
what your soul is and its importance.

Sans is the most sensational AI in the game. This character is known by either two or three things. One being his
puns, in the game he is a jokester who will often make puns in the places you encounter him. Another is his
mysteriousness, there is not much of a background to this character. What we do know he is very powerful, his
parents are gone, and he can remember some things after a reset. Sans is also known for using his so called
shortcuts when he teleports. He is well liked by the other monsters in his hometown snowdin. He and his 
brother are guardsman for the royal guard.
<br><p><p style="font-family:comic sans MS; font size: 25px;">
	His brother, <a href="http://undertale.wikia.com/wiki/Papyrus">Papyrus,</a href="http://undertale.wikia.com/wiki/Papyrus">
 who hates puns, wishes to be hired for the royal guard sohe is always trying to work hard. He loves
 making puzzles for the human but is not very good at making them work or capturing the human. He is
 also one of the bosses that if your health reaches near zero, he will stop the battle
 and send you back instead of killing you. Though Papyrus is very active and focused, sans
is not. Sans is also known for being lazy and slacking off, then he uses skeleton-related puns to say how
much he has worked.</p><br><p> <p style="font-family:comic sans MS; font size: 25px;">
In doing the genocide mode, you do not see sans after you kill his brother until the 
room that you fight him at the room before the throne room you will fight him. In this battle sans will talk
about how he was studying timelines and he picked up that the timelines were jumping left and right, stopping
and starting. Unlike other monsters, when you attack him he dodges them, due to his health being at 1hp and
the fact that you, done genocide mode, deal thousands of damage when attacking a boss.</p>
<br><br></p style="font-family:comic sans MS; font size: 25px;"><hr>
<strong><h2><center><font color="green">Undyne</font color="green"></center></h2></strong>
<hr><br><p>
Undyne is not much of a mysterious character but is pretty powerful. Undyne is the leader of the royal guard
and would not spare the human. Although going through pacifist mode, when you battle her you have to run away.
When doing this papyrus will call you and you will stop to answer it, so undyne stops where she was until the
call is over then resume chase.</p>
<br><p> Later you will go to her house with papyrus who she is good friends with
Undyne is then provoked by papyrus to befriend you, but she is rough with it. In the end of the visit, Undyne
ends up burning her own house down by being violent in cooking pasta. After this she goes to live. </p>
<br><p>When going through genocide rout, you
attack undyne and deal thousands of damage that cuts her in half. Despite  being destroyed, her shere own
determination causes her to transform into a "god form". In here her health is in the tens of thousans, so you have
to actually fight her.</p>
<br><br><hr>
<strong><h2><center><font color="red">Asgore</font color="red"></center></h2><strong>
<hr><br>
Asgore is the second to final boss, he is the king of the underground. Asgore is a gentle monster and regrets
having to kill you. He has to kill you because the monsters needs your seventh soul to break the barrier and 
let the monsters free. Either way you go, be genocide or pacifist or neutral, he will be there at the barrier
waiting to try to kill you. When in battle with him, he pulls out a trident and breaks the spare option on 
your screen making it only possible to fight to advance the battle. When his hp reaches zero, he offers you
his soul and you can choose to spare him. Upon doing this through neutral or pacifist mode the first time,
flowey will kill him and take the souls and become god.
